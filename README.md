# About
Modified source code from: https://github.com/kevineye/docker-shairport-sync

## Intro
[shairport-sync](https://github.com/mikebrady/shairport-sync) is an Apple
AirPlay receiver. It can receive audio directly from iOS devices, iTunes, etc.
Multiple instances of shairport-sync will stay in sync with each other and other
AirPlay devices when used with a compatible multi-room player, such as iTunes or
[forked-daapd](https://github.com/jasonmc/forked-daapd).

## Multi-arch Image
The below commands reference a
[Docker Manifest List](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/manifest/)
at [`ghcr.io/ragingtiger/shairport-sync:master`](https://github.com/ragingtiger/shairport-sync/pkgs/container/shairport-sync)
built using Docker's
[BuildKit](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/build_enhancements/).
Simply running commands using this image will pull
the matching image architecture (e.g. `amd64`, `arm32v7`, or `arm64`) based on
the hosts architecture. Hence, if you are on a **Raspberry Pi** the below
commands will work the same as if you were on a traditional `amd64`
desktop/laptop computer.

## Run
To simply run a container from the image in `daemon` mode:
```
docker run \
       -d \
       --restart=always \
       --net=host \
       --device /dev/snd \
       -e AIRPLAY_NAME=shairport-sync \
       ghcr.io/ragingtiger/shairport-sync:master
```

## Create
To create a container from the image (for later use):
```
docker create \
       --restart=always \
       --name=shairport-sync \
       --net=host \
       --device /dev/snd \
       -e AIRPLAY_NAME="shairport-sync" \
       ghcr.io/ragingtiger/shairport-sync:master
```
Then run this container by name using `docker start`:
```
docker start shairport-sync
```

### Parameters
* `--net host` must be run in host mode
* `--device /dev/snd` share host alsa system with container. Does not require
  `--privileged` as `-v /dev/snd:/dev/snd` would
* `-e AIRPLAY_NAME=Docker` set the AirPlay device name. If unset it defaults to
  "Docker"
* extra arguments will be passed to shairplay-sync (try `-- help`)

## Troubleshooting
A few little tips for getting your setup working

### Configure Audio Group Access
To set the volume max on your system, please make sure you are first in the
`audio` group by running the command:
```
$ groups $USER
USER: USER sudo audio docker
```
If your output contains the `audio` group, then you already have access. If not
then run the following:
```
sudo usermod -a -G audio $USER
```
This will add `$USER` to the audio group (and assumes you have
`sudo privileges`). **NOTE**: `you must reboot for this change to take effect!`

### Linux Volume Level
Assuming you have `audio` group privileges (see
[Configure Audio Group Access](#configure-audio-group-access)), you can adjust
the volume on linux with the `alsamixer` command:
```
$ alsamixer
```
which will bring up the following screen:

Simply use the `UP/DOWN arrow keys` to set the volume to what you want (here
it has been set to 100%).
